      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="meta">Product: CheckMyNews / Social Media Monitor</p>

      <p>
        The LIX is very attentive and vigilant regarding personal data protection issues.
        Ecole Polytechnique and Inria have each appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO)
        to ensure that their respective research units, including the Laboratoire
        d’Informatique de l’Ecole Polytechnique (LIX), comply with
        <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Collected</h2>
      <p>
        We collect information the user shared with ad platforms such as Facebook, as well as
        information that platforms such as Facebook inferred about the user based on actions.
        We collect this information from Ad Preferences Pages such as
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/</a>
        and the user’s Facebook timeline.
      </p>

      <p>Specifically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ads a user receives while browsing Facebook, ads clicked, accompanied explanations, posts linking to news organizations, and public posts.</li>
        <li>Ad and post engagement proxies: visibility time, mouse position/movement in ad area, reactions, comments, shares, ad-content actions, advertiser actions, and other interaction actions.</li>
        <li>News-site monitoring information: news articles read and reading duration.</li>
        <li>Hashed versions of email and Facebook ID, if shared with ad platforms.</li>
        <li>Potential inferred attributes (for example birthplace/location history, professional, financial/economic, and localization information) if shared or inferred by ad platforms.</li>
        <li>Connection information (for example IP address, browser type, operating system).</li>
        <li>Internet-related information.</li>
        <li>Application health indicators (for example ad blocker presence, Facebook connection activity).</li>
        <li>Survey responses when participants complete additional surveys.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Ads, explanations, posts, and Ad Preferences attributes may reveal special-category data
        inferred by platforms and may not be accurate. Surveys may also collect socio-economic
        profile and personality traits.
      </p>

      <h2>How Data Is Processed</h2>
      <p>
        Collected data are stored on a dedicated secured server and provided to academic researchers
        upon justified request. Access is granted through an authentication process after validation.

      <p>
        In accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, please note:

        <li>Personal data are confidential and only authorized research team members have access.</li>
        <li>Each personal-data processing operation must be reported to the relevant DPO.</li>
        <li>Data are kept for ten years.</li>
        <li>Data transfer to LIX partners may occur under signed contractual protections.</li>

        <li>No profiling or automated decision-making is performed about you based on this processing.</li>
      </ul>

        If you consent, your consent record and date may be stored for fifteen (15) years on project servers.
      </p>
